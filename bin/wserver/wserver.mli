(* module [Wserver]: elementary web service *)

(** [Wserver.f syslog addr port tmout maxc g]
    Starts an elementary httpd server at port [port] in the current
    machine. The variable [addr] is [Some the-address-to-use] or
    [None] for any of the available addresses of the present machine.
    The port number is any number greater than 1024 (to create a
    client < 1024, you must be root). At each connection, the function
    [g] is called: [g (addr, request) scr cont] where [addr] is the
    client identification socket, [request] the browser request, [scr]
    the script name (extracted from [request]) and [cont] the stdin
    contents . The function [g] has [tmout] seconds to answer some
    text on standard output. If [maxc] is [Some n], maximum [n]
    clients can be treated at the same time; [None] means no limit.
    [syslog] is the function used to log errors or debug info. It is
    called syslog because it is used with the same gravity levels, but
    it can be anything.

    See the example below.

(* Example:

   - Source program "foo.ml":
        Wserver.f
          (fun _ -> prerr_endline)
          None 2371 60 None
          (fun _ s _ ->
             Output.status conf Wserver.OK;
             Output.print_string conf "You said: %s...\n" s);;
   - Compilation:
        ocamlc -custom unix.cma -cclib -lunix wserver.cmo foo.ml
   - Run:
        ./a.out
   - Launch a Web browser and open the location:
        http://localhost:2368/hello   (but see the remark below)
   - You should see a new page displaying the text:
        You said: hello...

  Possible problem: if the browser says that it cannot connect to
      "localhost:2368",
  try:
      "localhost.domain:2368" (the domain where your machine is)
      "127.0.0.1:2368"
      "machine:2368"          (your machine name)
      "machine.domain:2368"   (your machine name)
      "addr:2368"             (your machine internet address)
